## Design approach

* Start with IEA-3.4-130 reference model
* Adjust rotor size, rated power, and tower height
* Perform twist optimization for max AEP
* Perform twist and chord optimization for max AEP, with max chord and stall constraints
* Perform twist and chord optimization for max AEP, with thrust shaving
* Perform spar cap optimization for min blade mass
* Perform tower layer thickness and diameter optimization for min tower mass
