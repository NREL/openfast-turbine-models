This is the legacy design workflow for distributed optimization. First the twist distribution is
optimized alone, then the twist and chord distributions are optimized together for aerodynamic
performance. Then, the blade internal structure is optimized to minimize mass. Finally, the tower
is optimized using the resulting rotor-nacelle assembly loads. The resulting geometries should be
carefully assessed to determine their viability.
