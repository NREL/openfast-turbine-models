# NREL-2.8-127
_2.8 MW turbine with 127 m diameter rotor, default hub height is 89 m_

**AWAKEN modelers should use the OpenFAST model in `20_combined_aerostruct_opt2/OpenFAST`.**

**Turbine operational curves generated by WISDEM are in `NREL-2.82-127_performance.csv`.**

The WISDEM model was designed with the following software stack:

* [IEA Task 37: 3.4 MW RWT](https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/IEA-3.4-130-RWT) (c036f783b160604b133a2e4b7317320fde055743) - includes more comprehensive model data for the reference wind turbine (RWT)
* [WISDEM](https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM) v3.13.x (228fb93b0e1c67db23efb705c55512898ebfee6d, ran on NREL Eagle HPC)
* [WEIS](https://github.com/WISDEM/WEIS) v1.2.x (76a1213579160a7b3446ec993e62d5f51c292f1f, ran on NREL Kestrel HPC)
* [OpenFAST](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast) v3.5.2 (4b6337fcffe859c5eeb5445deeef2046439e5152 ran on NREL Eagle and Kestrel HPC)
* [ROSCO](https://github.com/NREL/ROSCOA) v2.9.0 (b994e4de67c423ff598a4bb354657b62ff61a50d)

The starting RWT geometry is based on the example provided in the WEIS repository, last modified 2022-07-27 (commit 2c30dff082f6cc9a091da8db8eb2ed2c2bb9728f)

To get started, modifications to the baseline turbine geometry can be shown with
`diff ../IEA-3p4-130-RWT.yaml NREL-2.8-127.start.yaml` inside the design directories.

The final geometry was designed in two steps:

1. Complete aerostructural optimization, but without stall margin constraint
2. Repeat with stall margin constrained to >= 3 deg

Details are provided in Quon et al., 2024, _Design of Wind Turbine Models for the American WAKE ExperimeNt (AWAKEN)_ -- manuscript in preparation.
