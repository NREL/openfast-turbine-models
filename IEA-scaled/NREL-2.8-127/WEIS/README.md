# WEIS driver

* `weis_driver.py` will run DLC1.1 for 10 wind speeds (with 2 m/s bins) and six
  turbsim seeds to produce a turbulent power curve
* The input geometry comes from the WISDEM design (step 4), which includes
  aerostructural optimizations for the blade and tower
* The resulting openfast model (in the OpenFAST folder) was automatically
  generated for during the DLC calculation
